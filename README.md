# The Genesis

This repository contains all of the project repositories that I worked on at the start of my software engineering career in 2020 during the COVID. This project marked the start of my journey and exemplifies my interest in this tech journey. As a result, I value them so highly that I want to consolidate them all into a single repository just to clear out my github.
